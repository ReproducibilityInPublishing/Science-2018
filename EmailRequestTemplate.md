Dear ,

I am a student in the Statistics Department at Columbia University, and recently came across your publication "-" in Science Magazine.

I would like to access [the data, code] from your paper. Could you either point me to where [the data, code] can be downloaded, or possibly send me the associated files? 

Sincerely,
